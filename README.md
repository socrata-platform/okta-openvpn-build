A project for packaging the Okta OpenVPN plugin.

This project currently builds packages for Ubuntu 16.04/14.04 and
RHEL/CentOS/etc. 7/6.

Requirements
------------

This project is distributed as a Chef cookbook that contains an FPM Cookery
packaging recipe. This allows for automated builds in Vagrant or Docker
environments using Test Kitchen.

Usage
-----

The included Test Kitchen config handles all the builds automatically for the
supported platforms. Normally, these builds will be kicked off and run on the
CI server, which will use Test Kitchen to assemble new packages, install them,
verify them, and publish them to PackageCloud.io.

Should the need arise, `fpm-cook` commands can still be run from the project
directory in `files/default/fpm-recipes`.

Recipes
-------

***default***

Configures the included helper libraries and ties the below recipes together.

***_build***

Installs build dependencies and runs `fpm-cook`.

***_verify***

Installs the newly-built package and runs a set of ServerSpec tests against it.

***_deploy***

If an attribute is set to enable it, uploads the artifact to PackageCloud.io.

Libraries
---------

***helpers***

Helper methods for interacting with the PackageCloud API and handling the
generated package files.

Attributes
----------

***default***

Includes attributes for enabling artifact publishing, a PackageCloud API token,
and the package version and revision to use in the build.
